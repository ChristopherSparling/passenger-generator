I've only known her for a while, And she came as some surprise, I see the sunshine when she smiles, I feel the rain fall when she cries, 
She hits me in the heart, She drops me to my knees, And I don't know where I'd be without you, Sweet Louise, 
Oh, well she flies just like a bird, And she floats just like a dream, And she's the sweetest song I've heard, And the sweetest face I've seen, 
And she hits me in the heart, And she drops me to my knees, I don't know where I'd be without you, My sweet Louise, 
They say patience is a virtue, Yeah she wait, she won't desert you, She's got hands that couldn't hurt you if they tried, 
With all that happiness she has, Well she loves and understands me, But oh Lord I know she's always by my side, 
So if you please put me at ease, My sweet Louise, 
And she hits me in the heart, Oh and she drops me to my knees, I don't know know everything about you, Yeah but you give me no reason to doubt you, And I don't wanna be without you, Sweet Louise
Well, I am the boy who cried wolf, And I know I've lied in the past, But last night I saw his yellow eyes shining in the dark, Yeah, I know I spun tales with his voice, And I open my mouth too fast, But last night I saw his footprints in the path, 
Well, I could swim every sea from south pole to north, But I know I'll only ever be the boy who cried wolf, 
Well, I am the shepherd's only son, And I know what a joke I've become, I have an honest heart but I have lies on my tongue, I don't know how it started or where it came from, And you have no reason and I have no proof, But this time I swear, I'm telling the truth, I saw that old wolf, from tail to tooth, And I know that he's hungry and he's coming down too, 
Well, I could swim every sea from south pole to north, And I could climb every tree and scale every course, And I could share only the truth from this day forth, But I know I'll only ever be the boy who cried wolf, 
Oh, oh, I am the boy who cried wolf, Oh, oh, I am the boy who cried wolf
When I built these walls with bricks and stones, I built them all around, I built these walls a long time ago, She ain't gonna take 'em down, No, she ain't gonna break 'em down, I built these walls with my two hands, I laid every single part, And behind these walls a coward stands, An ego and a broken heart, An ego and a broken heart, 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, she comes around, See if I don't get lost, I won't get found, Oh-oh-oh.oh, and turn it 'round, See if I don't go up, I won't come down, I won't come down, 
When I built these walls around my chest, I built them thick and strong, Oh, and she can try her very best, But they've been here for too long, For long ago there was a girl, That stood there where she stands, But she reached right in into my heart, And broke it in her hands, Oh, she broke it in her hands, 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, and I suppose, If there's no rain of clouds, Nothing grows, Oh-oh-oh, but this I know, If I don't get high, I won't get low, Oh-oh-oh, and I find her strange, She wants to climb up, But she could fall, Oh-oh-oh, she said: I won't change, And I live and die, Behind these walls, Behind these walls, Behind these walls
Well, I walked out this evening, Stood out in front of my house, To see the daylight leaving, My eyes pointed south, I felt like I was dreaming, I'd never seen the sky so red, Gave me the strangest feeling, And a voice inside me said, 
All my life I've been chasing setting suns, See me running up the hill when the evening comes, They get further away the faster that I run, I'm getting old and tired of chasing setting suns, 
Walked down to the ocean, And sat on the cold hard stones, Saw the seabirds fishing and the sunlight glistening, Down on my English home, Thought back to all the things I've seen, The people I know and the places I've been, The city skylines and the fields of green, It's a wonder I made it home, 
All my life I've been chasing setting suns, See me running up the hill when the evening comes, They get further away the faster that I run, I'm getting old and tired of chasing setting suns, 
Well, all my life I've been chasing setting suns, See me running up the hill when the evening comes, They get further away the faster that I run, I'm getting old and tired of chasing setting suns, I'm getting old and tired of chasing setting suns, Oh, and I'm getting old and tired of chasing setting suns
She's a whistle on the wind, A feather on the breeze, A ripple on the stream, She is sunlight on the sea, She's a soft summer rain, Falling gently through the trees, And I love her, 
She's cunning as a fox, Clever as a crow, Solid as a rock, She is stubborn as a stone, She's a hardheaded woman, And the best one that I know, And I love her, Yeah, well I love her, 
She's as new as the springtime, Strong as autumn blows, Warm as the summer, And soft as the snow, She's a thousand miles from here, But she's everywhere I go, 'Cause I love her, 
She loves me like a woman, She looks like a lady, She laughs like a child, And cries like a baby, I think that maybe she's the one that's gonna save me
There's somewhere I'd cross the sea, In a land that's lost and free, With my darling close to me, At least where I'm supposed to be, 
We're somewhere on the ocean breeze, And around the swinging trees, You're the only one for me, That is where I long to be, 
Someday, Someday yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
You're somewhere out upon the beach, Out of range and out of reach, With the truest love of mine, Underneath the bluest sky, 
Yeah, far away from any time, We'll watch the lazy sun go down, With my sweetheart I lay down, That is where I will be found, 
Someday, Someday yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, the past is the past, the future is not yet, The dye has been cast though the paint's no longer wet, If you're willing to forgive then maybe one day you'll forget, Darling, ain't that worth a try?, Ain't it worth a try when, Yesterday's gone and tomorrow is not here, The days they are longer, how they quickly disappear, If you learn to move on that's when the pathway becomes clear, 
Darling, ain't that worth a try?, Ain't it worth a try to see black from blue, Perhaps it's just a point of view, And maybe this one's down to you, my friend, In the end, 
For these moments that have gone, the summer's still to be, And every day that's past, it's just a raindrop on the sea, If you learn to let go maybe one day you'll be free, 
Baby, ain't that worth a try?, Ain't it worth a try to see black from blue, Perhaps it's just a point of view, Or maybe this one's down to you, my friend, Do you see grey from green?, Or all the colors in between?, But maybe this is just a dream, my friend, In the end
Claps of thunder and bolts of lightning, Wind comes howling through, Sometimes love is just a kite string, And a heart shaped at two, And holding on can be so frightening, I know she's frightened too, But I'll go dancing out in the thunder and lightning, If she will too, If she tells me she will too
Be a lantern burning, Never gonna go out, Oh, the winds are turning, Never gonna blow out, I've had a life of learning, I know people come and go, Be a lantern burning, Your fire burns low 
Be my lighthouse shining, Out on the sea, Be my silver lining, Be my golden key, I've had a life of climbing, Don't let me fall from the trees, Be my lighthouse shining, When I'm out on the sea
