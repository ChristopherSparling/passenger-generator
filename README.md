# passenger-generator
Generating [Passenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_(singer)) choruses and verses using neural networks

This project is a work in progress. Unfortunately due to the author aggresively querying the original website they intended to scrape they have been IP blocked from it. Am currently investigating ways around this, though the simplest would be to modify the script to query at a random, spaced out rate to reduce the liklihood of being blocked. An example of the output of the basic generations can be seen in _passenger-generated-text.txt_ using the _textgenrnn_ package.
